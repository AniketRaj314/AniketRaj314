## henlo, I'm Aniket
Elaborating more on my bio, I'm more than your average [geek](https://laughingsquid.com/nerd-venn-diagram-geek-dork-or-dweeb/) with a keen interest in community and tech.

I've mostly done frontend dev during my Engineering run, but then have been helping with Community at Devfolio since 2020. This includes hosting hackathons, running fellowships, supplying grants, and supporting builders by making them economically independent and opening new gates for them. 

On the side, I play Valorant (Platinum 3 hardstuck shushh). My other interests include:
- eSports (SEN City)
- Stoicisim (trying!)
- Listening to OSTs (Hans Zimmer is a diamond)
